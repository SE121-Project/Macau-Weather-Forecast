## **Background**
We found plenty of example about weather prediction when we study machine learning. After understanding the relevant information, we made a model of using the classical random forest in machine learning and simulated the rainfall situation in a region.

## **Working-method**
In this project we use decision tree in *sklearn* library (sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier) to predict the rain in Macao. 

- Data collecting
    - We download the observation data about rainfall of Macao during 2020-12-4 to 2021-12-4 from [SMG - Bureau of Geophysics and Meteorology](https://www.smg.gov.mo).
- Data cleaning
    - Some data of rainfall has been missing that can't be used to train model. So we set ```missing_values = ["--"]``` and use ```.dropna()``` to drop relative data.
- Model training
    - We use air pressuse (*air_pressure*), highest temperature (*high_tem*), average temperature (*aver_tem*), lowest temperature (*low_tem*), relative humidity (*relative_humidity*), sunlight time (*sunlight_time*), wind direction (*wind_direction*), wind speed (*wind_speed*) and rain accumulation (*rain_accumulation*) as all the features to train model.
    - We take 33% of the data as training set and set 10 as the maximum nodes of leaves to prevent overfitting.
    - Then take the last data as the testing set to simulate the rainfall condiation.
- Testing
    - The final test show the accuracy reaches 86% and 88%.
